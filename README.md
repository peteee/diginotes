# DigiNotes
A notes application that stores text, images etc. into IndexedDB storage

Using IndexedDB is hard, especially when you compare it to SQL/MariaDB. But for an offline storage equivalent, IndexedDB is an excellent choice if you want to store a lot of data, directly on the client-side. This ensures privacy an full control over a user's content.

## Features

- you can post text & pictures
- images will be stored as base_64 -encoded String, directly into the DB
- search single posts
- search multiple posts
- update posts | under construction
- store & play audio files | under construction
- like images/ posts | under construction
- store date of the post
- create a JSON back-up txt file
- restore the back-up
- display posts individually
- etc.

## This is currently under development and will undergo more changes soon
